# Architecture

Code is grouped by feature. Each frontend feature owns its UI, behavior, styles and feature-specific API calls. Server features own request validation and provider adapters; shared modules supply infrastructure. The app and server entry points compose these pieces.

| Folder / file | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Workspace composition, menus, sidebar tabs, layout and common styles |
| `src/features/player/` | Video UI, transport, shortcuts, captions, and VideoPlayerController |
| `src/features/story-flow/` | Clip graph model, filmstrip canvas, inspector, templates, routing, generation dependencies and migration |
| `src/features/call-response/` | Shared branching playback engine and legacy project adapters |
| `src/features/timeline/` | Shared filmstrip thumbnails and legacy timeline components |
| `src/features/interstitials/` | Draft editor/list, persistence/migration and independent generation-job lifecycle |
| `src/features/project/` | ProjectController, IndexedDB projects/assets, Blob URL resolution, portable archive validation and import/export |
| `src/features/voice-input/` | Voice panel, MicrophoneController, local speech detection, recording and submission |
| `src/features/video-analysis/` | Segment selection, captions/descriptions and analysis requests |
| `src/media/` | MediaEngine, TimelineComposition, GeneratedPlaybackMedia and CompositionRenderer: inspection, generated media preparation, clipping and explicit export |
| `src/shared/` | Shared HTTP/upload transport and accessible resize control |
| `server/features/voice-input/` | Audio/context validation and OpenAI/Gemini spoken-answer adapters |
| `server/features/video-analysis/` | Clip/frame validation and OpenAI/Gemini caption adapters |
| `server/features/comfy/` | Comfy Cloud reference validation, workflow submission, polling, progress and output downloads |
| `server/shared/` | HTTP protection/errors, temporary uploads, media validation and SDK clients |
| `server/app.ts`, `server/providers.ts` | Route and provider composition; no feature implementations |
| `server/hosting.ts` | Vercel authentication, direct upload tokens, bounded downloads and cleanup |
| `shared/contracts.ts` | API contracts and time/range helpers shared by browser and server |
| `shared/constants.ts` | All AI model IDs, limits and voice detection settings |
| `tests/interstitials/`, `tests/voice-input/`, `tests/browser/`, `tests/fixtures/` | Controller/composition tests, browser coverage and reusable media fixtures |

Feature APIs use shared HTTP transport; shared transport does not import feature code. Browser code never imports server implementations. Model IDs remain centralized in `shared/constants.ts`.
